# Solution Notes

## Day 14

Today's puzzle was about visualizing a grid, and it's always helpful to be able to visualize that in code. However, it's not always possible to maintain a grid structure when solving the problems, in fact, it's often much, _much_ easier if you only maintain the data that you need to solve the problem, then things like offsets, min and max grid, falling off the grid, all of that code becomes trivial to implement.

In part 1, I made the unwise decision to visualize the data with a grid, and worked very hard to so (since the initial offsets were given, but the min and max were not, I had to guess at the min and max!) This led to a fabulous tool for visualizing the data, and debugging the code, that looked something like this:

Super fun! But then part 2 came along.. and in part two the pain of expanding the grid was suggested. By that I mean, it was evident from the specs in the instructions that you would need to expand the grid 'as you went along'. This is never a fun operation, but when you are sleepy, and you think you are close to the solution, you may find yourself trying to grow grids left and right by adding columns whenever they are neccessary. This did not make for simple readable code!

So I woke the next morning and converted it all to using a `Map` instead of a `Field` (`Field` is a class maintained in this repo that is for rendering and working with grids.)

I then solved the problem in 10 minutes using most of the code from part 1 and solving for the cases where a Position was unknown, and when it 'went off the endge'

Lesson Learned!
